## How it works

Contains 8b10 encoder and decoder, 9-bit symbols can be pushed in and results pop out a bunch of clocks later

## How to test

To be added

## External hardware

Set up the board to use a manual clock. The manual clock is divided by 10 to generate the internal clocks 

- input data is 9 bit {uio\_in[0], ui\_in}  enable strobe is uio\_in[4]., it is clocked by the clock that is driven onto uioi\_out[6]

- output data is 9 bit {uio\_out[1], uo\_out}  enable strobe is uio\_in[3]., it is clocked by the clock that is driven onto uioi\_out[5]

- during reset uio\_in[0] is samp0led and if high the scrambler is enabled (on both units)

To test:

- only bits 0 and 4 on the bidirectional pins are used as inputs, set the reset of the pins to outputs

- assert reset and set uio\_in[0] to 1 and uio\_in[4] to 0, generate 5 clocks

- deassert reset

- generate 20-30 clocks - note that uio\_out[5] and uio\_out[6] should generate square waves 5 clocks up and 5 clocks down (not necessarily in sync with each other)

- uio\_out[7] should be 0 (not synced)

So send {b[8], b[7:0]}
- send clocks until uio\_out[6] is low

- set uio\_in[4] to 1, set uio\_in[0] to b[8] and set ui\_in to b[7:0]

- send clocks until uio\_out[6] is high

- set uio\_in[4] to 0

----------------------------------

- to start up the link send a COM character {1'b1, 8'hbc}

- run clocks until uio\_out[7] is asserted (indicating thge link is locked) as that happens the output clock may misbehave as it syncs up

- run another 10 clocks

- now send some characters with b[8] set to 0

- after each character wait until uio\_in[3] is asserted and check that the outputs are the same as what you sent in

- repeat the last 2 steps
