## How it works

AND, NAND and OR gates are connected to input a and b. 

16 flip flops are used to divide the clock speed with 2 outputs, one at the 12th flop and one at the 16th. 

## How to test

Set the inputs and check the outputs match with the expected results:

| input a and b | output AND | output NAND | output OR|
|---------------|------------|-------------|----------|
|0 0            |0           |1            | 0        |
|0 1            |0           |1            | 1        |
|1 0            |0           |1            | 1        |
|1 1            |1           |0            | 1        |

Set the clock to 10kHz and you should see the 5th output flashing quickly and the 4th ouput flashing slowly.
